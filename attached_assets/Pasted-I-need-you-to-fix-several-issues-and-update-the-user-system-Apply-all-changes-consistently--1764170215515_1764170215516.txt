I need you to fix several issues and update the user system. Apply all changes consistently:

---

### 1. Fix the profile initials crash
The current code uses:
((user.firstName || "")[0] + (user.lastName || "")[0]).toUpperCase()

This causes a runtime error because firstName and lastName no longer exist or are not strings.  
Replace this logic with initials based on **username** only.

Use this format:
const initials = (user.username?.[0] || "U").toUpperCase();

Remove any dependency on firstName or lastName in the frontend AND backend.

---

### 2. 404 errors when clicking level cards or logging out
Fix routing so:
- Clicking a level card correctly navigates to its level details page.
- Logging out redirects to `/` (home page) without 404 errors.
- Any path generated by the app must exist in App.tsx.

Check the following:
- Level details route is defined (ex: `/level/:id`).
- All `<Link>` components are pointing to valid routes.
- No dynamically generated links point to missing pages.

---

### 3. Lock “Submit Record” when not logged in
On every list page and navbar:
- Disable the “Submit Record” button if the user is NOT logged in.
- Instead of navigating, show a small message or modal saying:
  “You must be logged in to submit a record.”

Keep the design consistent.

### 4. Remove firstName / lastName from the user schema
Update the entire system to use **username only**.

Changes required:
- Remove `firstName` and `lastName` fields from the database schema.
- Remove them from all API responses.
- Remove them from all user creation / login flows.
- Remove them from the UI (profile, settings, admin user list, etc.).
- Ensure login only requires the username (Replit Auth username).

Make sure no leftover code references firstName or lastName.

### 5. Update the database
After removing firstName and lastName:
- Run a migration that drops these columns from the user table.
- Make sure nothing in the backend expects these fields anymore.

---

Apply all changes cleanly without breaking existing features.
Make sure the app compiles and all routes work.
