I need you to fix several issues in the project. Please apply all fixes cleanly without removing existing functionality.

---

### 1. Profile page initials crash
The profile page crashes with:
((user.firstName || "")[0] + (user.lastName || "")[0]).toUpperCase is not a function

Fix this by:
- Removing firstName and lastName entirely from the user model.
- Use ONLY `username` everywhere.
- Replace initials logic with: const initials = (user.username?.[0] || "U").toUpperCase()

Also remove first/last name fields from:
- The user schema
- The signup/login UI
- Any backend references

### 2. Clicking a level card OR logging out → 404 Page Not Found
Fix routing issues:
- Level cards should correctly link to `/level/:id`
- Create or fix the LevelPage route in App.tsx
- Make sure the logout redirect goes back to `/` without triggering a 404
- Ensure all list pages correctly wrap level cards in <Link> components pointing to the proper route

---

### 3. Lock submit-record button when logged out
If the user is NOT logged in:
- The Submit Record button should be disabled
- Clicking it should show a message like: “You must log in to submit a record.”
- If logged in, the button works normally.

### 4. Fix 403 Forbidden when dragging levels
Dragging a demon in Manage Demons causes a 403 error.  
Fix this by:
- Ensuring moderators have permission on the reorder endpoint
- Checking that the correct auth middleware is applied
- Making sure the drag-and-drop request includes the user session/token
- Making sure backend role checks match the moderator role in the database

---

### 5. Dashboard stats in the admin panel don’t load
Fix the dashboard API:
- Confirm the admin stats endpoint returns valid JSON
- Ensure the frontend fetch uses the correct route
- Make sure “listType” is passed if needed
- Ensure auth is applied correctly so the request isn’t blocked

---

### 6. Level card click still shows 404 page
Even after previous changes, clicking a level card still leads to:
"404 Page Not Found – Did you forget to add the page to the router?"

Fix by:
- Making sure `/level/:id` is added as a Route in App.tsx
- Ensuring the LevelPage component is imported and rendered
- Ensuring the link for each level card uses `/level/${level.id}`

Please implement all fixes cleanly across the frontend and backend.  
Do NOT remove any other features.
